BankBase is an app that demonstrates basic CRUD operations. Users have the ability to create a new account with BankBase and after a new account is created,
they may create new checkings / savings accounts that are associated. Users also have the ability of transferring and receiving transactions, as well
as tracking the transactions. React Native, JavaScript, and Redux Tool-kit are used for the frontend development, while I chose to use Firebase for data storage.
